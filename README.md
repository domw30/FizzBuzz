# FizzBuzz

The goal of Fizzbuzz is to introduce Test Driven Development (TDD) and Pair Programming.

The aim of the task is to work through this kata with a pair partner. Take turns on the keyboard as the driver. Swap driver/navigator roles, ensuring that the maximum time one person is driving is 15 minutes.

I completed this task during week 4 of Makers Acadmey Precourse with my Mentor Stephen Khan. This was a good opportunity to practice
pair programming and have an introduction to TDD.

What is FizzBuzz?

Fizzbuzz is a simple coding challenge, often described as a code kata. The objective of Fizzbuzz is to create a program with the following specification:

The program can be passed a number.
When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message 'Fizz'.
When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message 'Buzz'.
When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message 'Fizzbuzz'.
In all other cases, the program simply returns the given number.
